# Lottery
For MS2's to figure out their lottery rankings!

Got bored of thinking about salt and water and I forgot about doing this until tonight, so I made this script to help with lottery ranking decisions! To use it, go to this link for a Google colab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vPbZxFawl5orfoI7-cpvt1I_M_8W-BKe?usp=sharing. Save a copy to your drive (File -> Save copy to drive), open it, then follow the instructions there!

Alternatively:
1. Download the code and unzip the folder.

2. Open Terminal/Command prompt, type "jupyter notebook path_to_Lottery.ipynb", then press Enter (path_to_Lottery.ipynb should be replaced with the path to the file on your computer) OR navigate to the folder in Terminal/Command prompt and run "./lottery.sh"

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook!
