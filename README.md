# Lottery
For MS2's to figure out their lottery rankings!

Got bored of looking at kidneys and I forgot about doing this until tonight, so I made this script to help with lottery ranking decisions! To use it:
1. Download the "Lottery.ipynb" file.

2. Open Terminal/Command prompt, type "jupyter notebook path_to_Lottery.ipynb", then press Enter (path_to_Lottery.ipynb should be replaced with the path to the file on your computer.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook!
